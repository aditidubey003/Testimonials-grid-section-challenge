        and the subjects I learned 
        were current, if not more so,

        <p>  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years
           before I joined the bootcamp.
            I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard
           some people who had an amazing
            experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course
           and found it incredibly fun!
            I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best -
           and most grueling - time of my life.
            Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched
           careers, working as a Software
            Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          <p>  ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp,
             I‚Äôve never written a line of code. 
             I needed some structure from 
            professionals who can help
             me learn programming step by step.
              I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
            student of theirs who can 
            only say wonderful things about
             the program. The entire curriculum 
             and staff 
            did not disappoint. They were very
             hands-on and I never had to wait 
             long for assistance. The agile team 
            project, in particular, was outstanding.
             It took my learning to the
              next level in a way that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often
             referred to it during interviews 
             as an example of my developent 
            experience. It certainly helped me 
            land a job as a full-stack developer
             after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
